**Hi! I've created a safe experimental development environment for us to work with GitHub Copilot and learn new tools.**

**Setup (30 minutes, one time):**
1. Install Docker Desktop and VS Code
2. Install "Dev Containers" extension in VS Code
3. Run this in PowerShell:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BurtHarris/dogeTech.git
   cd dogeTech
   code .
   ```
4. Click "Reopen in Container" when VS Code asks
5. Wait for it to build (10 minutes first time)

**Result**: You'll have the exact same development environment as me - safe to experiment with any tools without breaking your Surface laptop!

**Documentation**: Check the files in the `docs/` folder, especially `GETTING_STARTED.md`
